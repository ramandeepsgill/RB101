Given this nested Hash:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.

Problem Description

- The input hash is a nested hash in that the value part of the key, value pair is a hash
- Output:  32 + 402 + 10 => 444

Algorithm:

-

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

total_age = 0

munsters.each do |_, value1|
    if value1["gender"] == "male"
      total_age += value1["age"]
    end
end
